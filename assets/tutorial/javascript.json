It is developer-friendly and high level programming language.<br><br><h3>2) Expressive Language</h3>Python language is more expressive means that it is more understandable and readable.<br><br><h3>3) Interpreted Language</h3>Python is an interpreted language i.e. interpreter executes the code line by line at a time. This makes debugging easy and thus suitable for beginners.<br><br><h3>4) Cross-platform Language</h3>Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix and Macintosh etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language.<br><br><h3>5) Free and Open Source</h3>Python language is freely available at offical web address.The source-code is also available. Therefore it is open source.<br><br><h3>6) Object-Oriented Language</h3>Python supports object oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence.<br><br><h3>7) Extensible</h3>It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our python code.<br><br><h3>8) Large Standard Library</h3>Python has a large and broad library and prvides rich set of module and functions for rapid application development.<br><br><h3>9) GUI Programming Support</h3>Graphical user interfaces can be developed using Python.<br><br><h3>10) Integrated</h3>It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, JAVA etc."
